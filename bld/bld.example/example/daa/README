Changelog:

02042008:
   The previous version daa.05302006.tar has been changed in two ways:

      a. Lines 568 of daa() and 736 of daav() in daa.c have an 'int' pointer cast
         changed to an 'unsigned long' pointer cast.
         Lines 566 of daa() and 734 of daav() in daa.cpp have an 'int' pointer cast
         changed to an 'unsigned long' pointer cast.
         This is to be compatible with i586/i686 architecture machines and their
         usage of pointers that can be 64 or 32 bits.  This change has been back
         tested to i386 machines.

      b. The daa_test.c routine has been modified to change all '%d' to '%ld'.
         The latest GNU compiler complains about the former.

   The 'gcc --version' is: gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-33).  For
   other versions YMMV.
