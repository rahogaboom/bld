Changelog:

01302008:
   The previous version rdx.05172007.tar has been changed in two ways:

      a. The rdx_pat_search.article.2007.doc dile has been added to provide
         extended documentation.

      b. The rdx_pat_print() and rdx_pat_verify() routines have been modified to
         change all 'unsigned int's to 'unsigned long's.  This is to be compatible
         with i586/i686 archtecture machines and their usage of pointers that can
         be 64 or 32 bits.  This change has been back tested to i386 machines and
         still works.
