# each line is a valid target argument to bld.<project> e.g. './bld.<project> target'
# and will build one(that named) library or executable.  the order of target bld's
# is important.  if 'bld.<project> --all' is used to bld all targets then dependencies
# must be built first, that is, libraries then executables.  if a line begins with
# "END" then all targets after the "END" are ignored.
