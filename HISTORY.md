 bld-1.0.5.tar.gz - 

 bld-1.0.4.tar.gz - entirely perldoc updates.  example projects - bld-1.0.4-git.tar.gz, bld-1.0.4-svn.tar.gz
                    and bld-1.0.4-systemd.tar.gz.

 bld-1.0.3.tar.gz - moved four more routines from bld to BldRoutines.pm.  added new project version builds
                    for git(git-2.3.0.tar.gz) and svn(subversion-1.8.11.tar.gz).  improved error reporting.

 Why are there no releases beyond the latest three?  For now, I only intend to maintain and answer questions
 about the most recent releases.  This may change in future.
